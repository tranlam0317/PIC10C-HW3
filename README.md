The goal of this assignment is quite simple: to guide you through the process of writing a home-made iterator that does not involve delegation. Please be aware that you do not have to start from scratch. Instead you are to provide the missing code in ring_queue.cpp based on the description provided in this document.

If your code is correct, the output of your program should be similar to the one provided at the end of the file.
